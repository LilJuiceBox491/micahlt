## Hello, world! ðŸŒŽ
I'm Micah, a teen web developer, graphic designer, and musician making his way in the world of technology.  Beyond my interests in online web development, I'm interested in web technologies everywhere - projects like Apache Cordova, Electron, and more.  If you want to check out some of the projects I have worked on and am still working on, scroll down!  Or, check out [my website](https://micahlindley.com) for more information about me.
